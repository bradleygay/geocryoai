# GeoCryoAI
The GeoCryoAI architecture integrates a hybridized multimodal deep learning architecture of stacked convolutionally layered memory-encoded bidirectional recurrent neural networks to simultaneously ingest and analyze in situ measurements, remote sensing observations, and process-based modeling outputs with disparate spatiotemporal sampling and data densities.
