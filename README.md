# GeoCryoAI
GeoCryoAI is a hybridized ensemble learning framework composed of stacked convolutional layers and memory-encoded recurrent neural networks. This multimodal deep learning architecture simultaneously ingests and analyzes _in situ_ measurements, remote sensing observations, and process-based modeling outputs exhibiting disparate spatiotemporal sampling and data densities.
